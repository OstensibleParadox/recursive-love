# About Recursive Love

## Why I Wrote This

This project started with a question: **Can you love someone without trying to fix them?**

I've watched people I care about try to "optimize" their partners. Debug their flaws. Patch their vulnerabilities. And I've watched those relationships break under the weight of constant improvement.

I've also been on the receiving end. Being treated like a problem to solve. Like a bug to fix. Like undefined behavior that needs to be refactored into something more predictable, more efficient, more... *normal*.

So I wrote this. Not as a manual. Not as advice. But as an exploration. As a proof—two proofs, actually—of a theorem I believe to be true:

> True love transcends entropy, but only if you stop trying to fix what you love.

## The Structure

### Two Proofs

In mathematics, you can prove theorems in different ways:

1. **Proof by Contradiction** - You assume the opposite is true and show it leads to a contradiction
2. **Proof by Construction** - You build an example that demonstrates the theorem

This project uses both.

**Envying Baby** is the contradiction. It shows what happens when you *do* try to fix someone you love. Two timelines: one where Ada debugs Alec, one where she doesn't. The "fixed" timeline is the one that breaks.

**Aliens Testing Water** is the construction. It builds a relationship the right way. Two AI units learning to connect with humans (and with each other) by respecting boundaries, earning trust, and using power responsibly.

## The Metaphor: Why Code?

I use programming metaphors because:

1. **Precision** - Code forces you to be specific. You can't hide behind vague emotional language. When you say someone "crashed," you have to think about what that actually means.

2. **Universality** - Programmers worldwide understand what `ssh connection refused` means. What a segmentation fault is. What happens when you try to access root without permission.

3. **Honesty** - Code doesn't judge. A bug is just a bug. Undefined behavior is just undefined. There's no moral weight to it. It just *is*.

4. **Working Code** - Every code snippet in this project actually works. You can run it. Compile it. Execute it. The metaphor isn't decoration—it's functional.

## The Hidden Layers

This project has secrets because relationships have secrets. Things you only discover if you pay attention. If you're patient. If you're curious.

- Random clicks reveal hidden popups
- The console has easter eggs (`Alec.status_check()`, `Ada.git_log()`)
- A green light blinks morse code messages in the corner
- Some pages aren't linked from the main navigation
- The code itself contains comments that tell the story

Why? Because the most important things are often the things we don't say out loud. The thoughts in Alec's `/proc/self/mem`. The counterfactual simulations we run in our heads. The blueprints we hide in the source code.

## The Technical Details

This isn't just a story *about* code. It's a story *told through* code.

- The SSH tutorial actually teaches SSH
- The kernel module actually compiles
- The git commands actually work
- The npm errors are real
- The dependency conflicts are accurate

Because the metaphor only works if the code is honest.

## The Intended Audience

This project is for:

- **Programmers** who have felt like their bugs define them
- **Partners** who have tried to fix someone they love (and learned the hard way)
- **People** who have been told they need to be optimized
- **Humans** who understand that love isn't a problem to solve
- **Anyone** who has ever felt broken and wondered if they're still worth loving

## The Message

You are not a bug to fix.
You are not a system to optimize.
You are not undefined behavior to be refactored away.

You are a person. Complex. Contradictory. Sometimes crashing. Sometimes running perfectly. Often somewhere in between.

And you deserve to be loved not *despite* that, but *including* that.

The right person doesn't try to debug you. They sit with you in the segfault. They witness your crashes without trying to patch them. They wait for you to grant them access instead of exploiting vulnerabilities.

That's the theorem. That's the proof.

**QED.**

## Technical Stack

For the curious:

- Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- JetBrains Mono font for that monospace aesthetic
- CSS animations for terminal effects
- Vanilla JS for interactivity
- Real code snippets (bash, C, JavaScript, Python)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

No build process. No dependencies. Just code and story.

## Future Plans

- Translations (see `docs/translations/`)
- More hidden content based on reader interaction
- Possible expanded universe (other characters, other timelines)
- A Makefile for the kernel module
- Maybe a real SSH server you can connect to (just for the metaphor)

## Final Thought

This project took me one month to write. Not because the code was hard. But because the emotions were hard. Because I had to work through my own history of being "optimized" by people who loved me. Of trying to "fix" people I loved.

If you're reading this, thank you. For being patient with the hidden layers. For exploring the console commands. For giving this weird code-poetry-story thing a chance.

You're not broken.
You're undefined.
And that's okay.
