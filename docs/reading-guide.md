# Reading Guide

How to approach **Recursive Love** for the best experience.

## First Time Reading

### Start Here
1. **Read [the main landing page](../index.html)**
   - Get the vibe
   - See the terminal aesthetic
   - Understand the structure

2. **Choose a story** (either order works):
   - **Envying Baby** - If you prefer emotional, character-driven narratives
   - **Aliens Testing Water** - If you prefer structured, technical storytelling

3. **Read linearly** the first time
   - Don't hunt for secrets yet
   - Just experience the story
   - Let it sink in

4. **Then read the other story**
   - Notice how they mirror each other
   - Same theorem, different proof methods

5. **Open your browser console**
   - Try `RecursiveLove.help()`
   - Explore `Alec.status_check()` and `Ada.debug_log()`
   - Run `Theorem.qed()`

6. **Go back and find the hidden content**
   - Click around (not on links)
   - Watch the morse code indicator
   - Explore the hidden files

## Story Order

Both orders work, but they give different experiences:

### Option A: Envying Baby → Aliens Testing Water
- Start with the emotional gut-punch
- End with the constructive hope
- Journey from "what not to do" to "what to do"
- Recommended for first-time readers

### Option B: Aliens Testing Water → Envying Baby
- Start with the learning process
- End with the cautionary tale
- Learn the right way, then see the wrong way
- Good for re-reads or technical readers

## Reading Modes

### 1. Speed Read (30 minutes)
- Read just the main story pages
- Skip the hidden content
- Get the core theorem
- Good for: Quick overview, deciding if you want to dive deeper

### 2. Standard Read (1-2 hours)
- Read both stories linearly
- Try a few console commands
- Find 1-2 hidden secrets
- Good for: First-time readers, casual exploration

### 3. Deep Dive (3+ hours)
- Read everything
- Find all hidden content
- Read all console logs
- Read the technical appendix
- Compile the kernel module
- Decode the morse messages
- Good for: Completionists, developers, people who really connected with it

### 4. Technical Analysis (4+ hours)
- Read the code appendix
- Try all the commands
- Compile the kernel module
- Study the SSH tutorial
- Analyze the real CS concepts
- Good for: Programmers, CS students, tech nerds

## Reading for Different Audiences

### For Programmers
Focus on:
- The technical accuracy of the code

- The character development
- The emotional arcs
- The use of code as poetic language

Start with: `stories/envying-baby/index.html`

### For Relationship Explorers
Focus on:
- The core theorem
- The different timelines in Envying Baby
- The phase progression in Aliens Testing Water
- The hidden emotional content
- The final messages

Start with: `stories/envying-baby/special-timeline.html`

### For Interactive Fiction Fans
Focus on:
- The layered content structure
- The console commands
- The hidden secrets
- The morse code
- The metafictional elements

Start with: Open the console and type `RecursiveLove.help()`

## Tips for Maximum Enjoyment

1. **Use a desktop/laptop** - The console commands and terminal aesthetic work best on a full screen

2. **Use a modern browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all work. Needs JavaScript enabled.

3. **Turn off distractions** - This is not a skim-read. It rewards attention.

4. **Take breaks between stories** - Let each one sit with you before moving to the next.

5. **Read the code** - Even if you're not a programmer. It's written to be understood.

6. **Try the commands** - Don't just read about them. Actually run them.

7. **Look for patterns** - The number 47, the color schemes, the repeated phrases.

8. **Read the comments** - In the code, in the console, everywhere.

9. **Notice the details** - File permissions, timestamps, error codes—they all mean something.

10. **Come back later** - This project rewards re-reading.

## Understanding the Metaphors

If you're not a programmer, here's what you need to know:

- **SSH** = How you connect to someone's inner world
- **Root access** = Complete trust
- **Undefined behavior** = Unpredictable emotions (not broken, just unspecified)
- **Segfault** = Emotional crash
- **Debugging** = Trying to fix someone
- **Git commit** = Trying to change someone
- **Dependency hell** = You can't have love without trust
- **The Halting Problem** = You can't predict if love will last
- **Kernel module** = Deep, privileged access to someone's core

The rest you can figure out from context, or check `docs/technical-notes.md`.

## After You Finish

1. **Read the blueprint** - `/hidden/blueprint.html` explains why this exists

2. **Read the about page** - `docs/about.md` for the author's perspective

3. **Share it** - If it resonated with you, share it with someone who might need it

4. **Contribute** - Found a bug? Want to translate it? Open an issue on GitHub

5. **Reflect** - The real question: Are you trying to fix someone you love? Is someone trying to fix you?

## Content Warnings

This project deals with:
- Emotional manipulation (in the context of the "wrong way" to love)
- Relationship breakdowns
- Mental health struggles (metaphorically)
- The pain of being "optimized" by someone who loves you

It's not graphic. It's not explicit. But it might hit hard if you've lived it.

Take care of yourself. Take breaks if you need to.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. The metaphors are explained in context. But if you do code, you'll appreciate the accuracy.

**Q: How long is it?**
A: Each story is about 15-20 minutes. Hidden content adds another 30-60 minutes. Technical deep-dive can take hours.

**Q: Is there a "correct" reading order?**
A: Nope. Both stories stand alone. Read in any order.

**Q: Can I read this on mobile?**
A: Yes, it's responsive. But the console commands need a desktop browser.

**Q: Is this based on a true story?**
A: It's fiction. But it's emotionally autobiographical.

**Q: What's with all the green text?**
A: Terminal aesthetic. Classic hacker movie vibe. Also, green = hope, growth, life.

**Q: Why is there a blinking cursor everywhere?**
A: Because this is a live terminal. The story is still being written. Your story is still being written.

## Final Advice

Read it however feels right to you. There's no wrong way to experience this.

But if you find yourself in one of these stories—if you see yourself trying to fix someone, or being fixed by someone—maybe sit with that for a minute.

Maybe that's the real content. The part that isn't hidden. The part that's right in front of you.

**QED.**
