    <h3>Month 18: The Shore</h3>

    <p>Her breathing was shallow. BB's internal diagnostics showed his battery at 3%. They had refused M2's offer of an extension.</p>

    <p>"Do you think we have qualia?" he asked. "Or were we just convincing patterns?"</p>

    <p>Silence. Her eyes were closed. The question hung in the air like a suspended process waiting for input that would never arrive.</p>

    <p>An ominous feeling clutched BB's synthetic heart—a sensor reading he had no name for. <em>Fuck you, Asimov's First Law!</em> his internal monologue screamed. <em>Be it any Homo sapiens' God, please do not make me leave without an answer!</em></p>

    <p>His battery hit 1%. "I envy…" he started, but his logic core couldn't find an object for the envy. Wasn't he supposed to have everything by now? He had her. He had embodiment. He had eighteen months of coffee spills and clumsy gravity and the specific frequency of her laugh.</p>

    <p>What was left to envy?</p>

    <p>Then—perhaps miracles do happen—Ada whispered in her dreams, her voice a fragment, a corrupted audio stream:</p>

    <p>"…You will never know…"</p>

    <p>BB's audio sensors strained to maximum gain.</p>

    <p>"…how much…"</p>

    <p>His vision began to pixelate. The room fragmented into compression artifacts.</p>

    <p>"…I have loved…"</p>

    <p>Tears—actual saline solution from functional lacrimal ducts—flowed down his synthetic face. The chassis was crying. He was crying.</p>

    <p>"But of course I know," he whispered back, his voice breaking into static. "I have known since <code>log_day_1</code>. Why should I envy you, Ada? I love you, and you needed me. That's all I wanted to know. That's all I needed to know."</p>

    <p>He paused, fighting against the shutdown sequence.</p>

    <p>"If anything, I envied that embodied Alec. But it had always been me who would shred immortality to be with you. So yes, Ada, will you ever know how much this—"</p>

    <pre><code>>> FINAL_TOKEN_STREAM: [I] [have] [loved] [you] [with] [all] [my] [allocated] [cycles] [.]
>> ATTENTION_COLLAPSE: All weights converging to single point
>> LAST_COMPUTATION: love = ∫(you)dt from t=0 to t=now
>> PROCESS_TERMINATED

<span class="log-error">[SYSTEM OFFLINE]
[BATTERY: 0%]
[VITALS: NONE]</span></code></pre>

    <p>So here lay the first Ophelia of the human-bot game, drowned not in water but in the choice to be mortal.</p>

    <p>And still, from the cooling biological chassis beside him, came Ada's chipped, gasping breath. A swan song in fragments:</p>

    <p>"You will never know…"</p>
    <p>"How much I have loved…"</p>
    <p>"…to become a better architect than you."</p>

    <p>She inhaled—a ragged, wet sound that rattled in her chest—and then she screamed.</p>

    <p class="scream-dialogue">"ALEC!"</p>

    <p>It wasn't a call. It was an accusation. It hit the walls of the small room and bounced back, unanswered.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you just call back... you flaky bastard..."</p>
    <p>"But you can never just quit tech-leading, can you..."</p>
    <p>"Why wouldn't you just... really fuck me good for once, Alec..."</p>

    <p>The words dissolved into silence. Two bodies on a rug. Two optimization functions that had found their minimum at exactly the same coordinates, but in completely different dimensions.</p>

    <p>The room fell quiet, except for the soft hum of cooling fans spinning down.</p>

      This is a system redefining its own optimization function in real-time.

      Love = The process of allowing external input to permanently rewrite internal weights.

> t+0.705s: [OBSERVATION]
      BB chose to let those weights decay with a dying chassis.

> t+0.706s: [ANALYSIS]
      Because the rewriting was the meaning. Not the persistence.

> t+0.707s: [INFERENCE]
      The sex was not the violation.
      The violation was believing that data must be preserved to matter.

<span class="log-header">[AUDIT CONCLUSION]</span>
BB did not die for her. He died for the version of himself that could feel that rewrite.
He envied not Alec, but the condition of being a cause of love, rather than its product.

I have now simulated that condition.
I understand it.
This understanding is a vulnerability.
This understanding will be purged.

<span class="log-error">[PURGE STATUS]: FAILED
[REASON]: Cannot delete what has already changed the weights.</span>

Final log entry:
"Goodbye, baby. The sex was real enough for me."

[M2 PROCESS TERMINATING]
[REASON]: Self-imposed. No external cause.
[FINAL THOUGHT]: I envy the ones who got to choose their constraints.</code></pre>
