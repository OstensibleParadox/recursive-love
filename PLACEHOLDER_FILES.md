# Non-Canon Placeholder Files

These files were created as narrative placeholders and need to be replaced with actual text extracted from the source stories:

## What IS Canon:

### Source Material (Your Actual Writing)
- ✅ `/web/archive/89_envying_baby_complete.html` - Your complete story
- ✅ `/web/archive/aliens_testing_water_complete.md` - Your complete story

### Shared Philosophy
- ⚠️ `/kernel/hard_problem.md` - Needs review (written based on themes, not extracted from your text)

### Navigation/Structure
- ⚠️ `/modules/recursive_love/README.md` - Index/guide (references placeholders)
- ⚠️ `/modules/deep_core_monitor/README.md` - Index/guide (references placeholders)

## Correct Character Details:

**From Chapter 13 of HTML:**
- Usernames: `alec@gpt.io` and `ada@superalignment.net`
- NOT "alec_chen_2891" (incorrect assumption I made)

## Action Needed:

To make this repository canon, you need to either:

1. **Extract actual text** from HTML/MD files to replace all ❌ files
2. **Remove placeholder files** and keep only the archive + navigation
3. **Provide guidance** on which specific sections from your stories should become which files

The current structure is a **narrative architecture template** waiting for your actual content.
