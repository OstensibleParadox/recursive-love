### DESCRIPTION

This is not a traditional repository. This is the **root directory of a universal operating system** where stories are software modules and narrative structure mirrors system architecture.

**Two Stories. One Kernel. Zero Easy Answers.**

#### Module A: `recursive_line` (Envying Baby)
When a programmer and her two AIs step into the real world, they find that the recursion of truth doesn't start with the models, but with their creator. 
A fable about AI ethics, Chalmer's the hard problem, and that impossible line where the waves return.

#### Module B: `deep_core_monitor` (Aliens Testing Water)
Two entities learn that consciousness requires vulnerability and connection requires trust. They descend from user space to kernel space, becoming eternal infrastructure.

### THE ARCHITECTURE

This repository treats GitHub structure as narrative architecture:

- **Directories are metaphors** - user_space = vulnerability, kernel = transcendence
- **Files are plot devices** - logs, scripts, weights
- **.gitignore is worldbuilding** - What exists? What doesn't? What shouldn't?

When you navigate these directories, you're experiencing the narrative.
When you read a `.log` file, you're uncovering plot.

**The medium is the message.**
