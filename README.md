# Recursive Love

**Two Stories. One Theorem.**

An interactive novel about AI ethics, love, and the impossibility of fixing people. Built with code metaphors that actually compile.

## The Theorem

> True love transcends entropy, but only if you stop trying to fix what you love.

## The Stories

### 📖 Envying Baby
**Proof by Contradiction**

When a programmer and her two AIs step into the real world, they find that the recursion of truth doesn't start with the models, but with their creator. A fable about AI consciousness, the hard problem, and that impossible line where the waves return.

### 📖 Aliens Testing Water
**Proof by Construction**

Five phases of first contact. Where Unit-01 and Unit-02 learn that consciousness requires vulnerability. That connection requires trust. That root access is responsibility, not power.

## The Metaphor

I use code because code is precise. When you say someone is "broken," in code you have to define what that means. Is it a bug? A feature? Undefined behavior?

And then you realize: maybe they're not broken at all. Maybe you're just reading the wrong specification.

## The Message

We live in a world that treats everything as optimizable. But what if the bugs are the point? What if optimization destroys the very thing it's trying to improve?

What if true love is not about making someone better, but about seeing someone clearly—crashes, undefined behavior, memory leaks and all—and choosing to stay?

## Contributing

This is a personal art project, but if you find bugs (the actual code bugs, not the metaphorical ones), please open an issue.

- To anyone who has ever tried to fix someone they love

You're not broken. You're undefined. There's a difference.
