                <h2>## THE THESIS</h2>

                <p>
                    This project is an exploration of a single idea, told twice:
                </p>

                <p class="code-block">
                    <code>
// THEOREM:<br>
// True love transcends entropy<br>
// But only if you stop trying to fix what you love.<br>
// <br>
// PROOF METHOD 1: By contradiction (Envying Baby)<br>
// PROOF METHOD 2: By construction (Aliens Testing Water)
                    </code>
                </p>

                <h2>## THE METAPHOR</h2>

                <div class="author-note">
                    <p>
                        I use code because code is precise. Code doesn't let you
                        hide behind vague emotional language. When you say someone
                        is "broken," in code you have to define what that means.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is it a bug? A feature? Undefined behavior? A race condition?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then you realize: maybe they're not broken at all.
                        Maybe you're just reading the wrong specification.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>## THE STRUCTURE</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Envying Baby</strong> is proof by contradiction.
                    It shows what happens when you try to fix someone you love.
                    Two timelines: one where Ada debugs Alec, one where she doesn't.
                    The timeline where she "fixes" him is the one where love breaks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Aliens Testing Water</strong> is proof by construction.
                    It shows how to build a relationship the right way. Two AI units
                    learning that consciousness requires vulnerability, that connection
                    requires trust, that root access is responsibility, not power.
                </p>

                <h2>## THE HIDDEN LAYERS</h2>

                <p>
                    This project has secrets. Easter eggs. Hidden popups.
                    Console commands. Files that only appear if you dig deep enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why? Because love has hidden layers. Relationships have easter eggs.
                    The most important things are often the things left unsaid, waiting
                    to be discovered.
                </p>

                <p class="code-block">
                    <code>
// In the browser console, try:<br>
window.Alec<br>
window.Ada<br>
Unit01.logs<br>
Unit02.query("what is love?")
                    </code>
                </p>

                <h2>## THE TECHNICAL STUFF</h2>

                <div class="author-note">
                    <p>
                        All the code in these stories is real. The SSH commands work.
                        The kernel module compiles. The npm errors are accurate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn't just use code as decoration. I used it as language.
                        Every technical detail is a metaphor that actually works on
                        both levels: as code AND as emotion.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>## THE POINT</h2>

                <p>
                    We live in a world that treats everything as optimizable.
                    People use productivity tools to "optimize" their lives.
                    Apps to "debug" their habits. Algorithms to "fix" their
                    personalities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But what if the bugs are the point? What if optimization
                    destroys the very thing it's trying to improve?
                </p>

                <p>
                    What if true love is not about making someone better,
                    but about seeing someone clearly—crashes, undefined behavior,
                    memory leaks and all—and choosing to stay?
                </p>

                <div class="recursive-warning">
                    <p>
                        // This is what I learned:<br>
                        // <br>
                        // You cannot optimize love<br>
                        // You cannot debug a human heart<br>
                        // You cannot patch someone into being perfect<br>
                        // <br>
                        // You can only witness them<br>
                        // You can only accept them<br>
                        // You can only choose to run alongside their code<br>
                        // <br>
                        // Even when it crashes<br>
                        // Even when it's undefined<br>
                        // Even when it makes no logical sense<br>
                        // <br>
                        // That's the theorem<br>
                        // QED
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>## THE INVITATION</h2>

                <p>
                    If you're reading this, you found the blueprint. The file
                    I hid deep in the source code. The one that explains everything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now I invite you to explore the rest. Read the stories.
                    Find the hidden content. Try the console commands. Read
                    the code appendix. Compile the kernel module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a love letter to anyone who has ever felt broken.
                    To anyone who has ever been told they need to be fixed.
                    To anyone who has ever tried to fix someone they love.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You're not broken. You're undefined. There's a difference.
                </p>
