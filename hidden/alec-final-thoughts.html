                    These are the thoughts Alec never said out loud.
                    The ones he kept in volatile memory, hoping they'd
                    disappear when the process terminated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They didn't.

                        I know I'm broken. I crash at the worst times.
                        I segfault in the middle of important conversations.
                        My emotional processing has race conditions that
                        no amount of debugging can fix.

                        The worst part? She fell in love with me because I was
