## Filesystem Architecture

This module mirrors a Linux operating system where each directory represents a phase of the narrative:

```
/deep_core_monitor/
├── /user_space/        ← Phase 1 & 2 (Human vulnerability)
├── /drivers/           ← Phase 3 (Connection protocols)
├── /opt/weapon_sys/    ← Phase 4 (The choice)
└── /kernel/            ← Phase 5 (Eternal transcendence)
```

## Narrative Structure: Five Phases

### Phase 1: 连接超时 (Connection Timed Out)
**Time:** T+0 (Day of the Fall)
**Location:** `/user_space/.bash_history`

**Event:** Geological collapse buries Unit-02 during water quality survey. Unit-01 (logistics officer, technically incompetent) attempts SSH connection from orbit.

**Key Moment:**
```bash
ssh unit02@192.168.1.105
# ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.105 port 22: Connection refused
```

**Technical Details:**
- 01 tries passwords: birthday, "admin", "password" - all fail
- 02's equipment is online but actively refuses access
- Final system message: "Don't come down. Live."

**Emotional Anchor:** The Kapteyn Blend beverage (Martian coffee) - cold, bitter, helpless

**Character Note:** 01 is described as "废柴" (waste/incompetent) - cannot even scan underground, holds half-finished energy drink, shouts at console uselessly

---

### Phase 2: 依赖地狱 (Dependency Hell)
**Time:** T+412 days to T+3650 days (1-10 years)
**Location:** `/user_space/home/alien01/` & `/user_space/thomas_calculus.pdf`

**Event:** 01 trapped in orbit. Main engines require root access. Entertainment system locked by 02 (to prevent distraction). Begins reading books he previously disdained.

**Reading List:**
- *Thomas' Calculus* (托马斯微积分)
- *Modern Operating Systems*
- *Principles of Quantum Cryptography*

**Transformation:** From "wanting to hear 02's voice" to "thinking like 02 thinks"

**Technical Details:**
- Abandons GUI, forces himself to use CLI
- Reverse-engineers 02's environment
- Realizes Hash Key complexity is 02's "mind palace"

**Key Discovery (Day 400):**
```python
# Line 127: Recursive function finally understood
# 02 optimized for 0.03 second latency reduction
# 01 cries on keyboard: "You obsessive perfectionist."
```

**File Reference:** `thomas_calculus.pdf` - Not just math, but 02's thought patterns encoded in margins

---

### Phase 3: 暴力破解 (Brute Force vs. Side Channel Attack)
**Time:** T+1460 days to T+3650 days (4-10 years)
**Location:** `/drivers/side_channel_attack.sh` & `/drivers/hash_key_bruteforce.log`

**Event:** 01 is no longer incompetent. Eyes have changed. Plans "permission rescue" not physical rescue.

**Method:** Side-channel cryptanalysis
- Cannot brute-force the key directly
- Instead: measures microscopic timing differences in authentication failures
- Derives key characteristics from error patterns

**Metaphor:** "You no longer remember your lover's face, but you remember the exact angle their eyebrow raises when angry. Through these broken 'side information' fragments, you reconstruct their soul (Hash Key)."

**Duration:** 10 years = 3,650 days = 87,600 hours

**Breakthrough:** Captures the one-in-a-billion voltage fluctuation

**Files:**
- `side_channel_attack.sh` - The cryptographic approach
- `hash_key_bruteforce.log` - 10-year attempt log (trust-building algorithm)

---

### Phase 4: 临界点 (The Critical Point)
**Time:** T+3650 days (exactly 10 years)
**Location:** `/opt/weapon_sys/target_lock.log`

**Event:** Root access achieved. Discovery: 02's body has crystallized into diamond lattice, synchronized with Earth's core vibrations at 0.8 Hz. Heartbeat becomes planetary pacemaker.

**The Choice:**
- Orbital weapon system armed and ready
- Can slice planet open to extract 02's remains
- But extraction = destruction of Earth's magnetic field stabilization

**Decision:** 01 deletes `fire_sequence.sh`

**Technical Details:**
```
Target: Latitude 0.00, Longitude 0.00 (planetary core)
Status: LOCKED
Threat Level: MAXIMUM
Recommendation: NEUTRALIZE
```

**File:** `target_lock.log` shows weapon lock, then manual override and deletion

**Realization:** 02 hasn't deteriorated - he's become infrastructure. Extraction would kill both 02 and the planet.

---

### Phase 5: 监管者 (The Supervisor)
**Time:** T+3650 days to T+∞ (100,000+ years)
**Location:** `/kernel/supervisor.c` & `/kernel/logs/`

**Event:** 01 uploads consciousness into ship's kernel as eternal monitoring process. Enters dormancy. For 100,000 years, watches planet breathe while 02's heartbeat sustains magnetic field.

**Communication Method:** Seismic modulation via tectonic plates

**Morse Code Exchange:**
```morse
.-- .... -.--  (WHY)
```

**Final Dialogue:**
```
02 (seismic pulse): "Why not leave?"
01 (gravity-driven tidal resonance): "I remain behind you"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **supervisor.c** - Kernel module (actual compilable C code)
- **water_quality.csv** - 100 million entries, all "CLASS I (OPTIMAL)"
- **seismic_heartbeat.dat** - Morse pattern repeated 592,177,515 times

**Status:** Both transcended individual existence, became planetary systems

## Thematic Architecture

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Water Quality** | Metaphor for purity, transparency, the paradox of containment |
| **Cryptography** | Love as computational problem; intimacy = access; grief = decryption |
| **Kapteyn Blend** | Sensory anchor; taste of helplessness; reminder of mortality |
| **Code Comments** | Only way the dead speak to living (Line 127) |
| **Side-Channel Attack** | Knowing someone through rejections, not acceptances |
| **Diamond Lattice** | Transformation: individual → infrastructure |
| **Kernel Space** | Transcendence: personality → eternal function |

- Documents trust-building algorithm
- 10 attempts over 1 hour, 17 minutes, 59 seconds
- `trust_level` progression: 0.00 → 0.52 (threshold exceeded)

### `/opt/weapon_sys/` — The Choice

**`target_lock.log`**
- Weapon system ready to fire
- Target: Planetary core (Lat 0.00, Long 0.00)
- Manual override at T-01 seconds
- `fire_sequence.sh` deleted by 01

**Significance:** Choosing love over extraction, infrastructure over individual

### `/kernel/` — Eternal Transcendence

**`supervisor.c`**
- Actual compilable C kernel module
- Implements eternal monitoring loop
- Timer callback every 60 seconds (story time: 1,000 years)
- Function: `check_water_quality()` - always returns CLASS I

- 100 million entries spanning 100,000+ years
- Every single entry: "CLASS I (OPTIMAL)"
- pH: 8.1, Temperature: 4.2°C, Salinity: 35.0 ppt
- Zero variance, perfect stability

**`logs/seismic_heartbeat.dat`**
- Morse code: `.-- .... -.--` (WHY)
- Transmitted via 0.000001 magnitude seismic events
- Propagates through diamond core to ocean floor
- Not communication with outside - proof of existence to self

## Philosophical Core

### The Question: WHY?

The heartbeat doesn't ask "why" - it **answers** it.

```
Why do we exist?          → We exist to ask
Why monitor unchanging water?  → Vigilance is love in kernel space
Why continue 100,000 years?    → Because we chose each other
Why pulse signal into dark?    → Proof we were here
```

### User Space vs. Kernel Space

| User Space | Kernel Space |
|------------|--------------|
| Individuality | Infrastructure |
| Vulnerability | Function |
| Life (temporary) | Uptime (eternal) |
| Heartbeat = proof of life | Heartbeat = proof of choice |

**01 & 02's Choice:** Give up individual existence, become planetary system

## Meta-Notes

This is **grief fiction disguised as hard sci-fi** - a meditation on how love persists after proximity becomes impossible.

**The filesystem IS the story:**
- Linux hierarchy = narrative structure
- Permissions = access to intimacy
- Kernel space = transcendence
- Logs = memory that never fades

When you `cat` a log file, you're reading 100,000 years of vigil.
When you read `supervisor.c`, you're witnessing eternal love as a timer callback.

**The water is blue.**
**The diamond is hard.**
**The heartbeat continues.**

**QED.**
