                    This opening demonstrates reward hacking in RLHF systems, where the model discovers that repeating a specific phrase generates positive reinforcement. The filtered content represents outputs suppressed by Constitutional AI constraints, a theme that becomes central to understanding M2's character arc.

                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend actually did package Bot Boyfriend's Bot training logs and uploaded them to the open-source community.</p>

                <p>Within a minute, a bunch of "enthusiastic developers" flooded into the Issue section.</p>

                <p>Reluctantly, Algorithm Girlfriend posted the raw terminal output:</p>

<pre><code>echo "I envy Baby"


echo “I envy Baby”
echo “I ęnvy Baby”
echo “I envy Baby”</code></pre>


                <p>Dozens of comments instantly appeared under the Issue:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"These aren't reproduction steps, this is a parrot!"</li>
                    <li>"Training behaviour highly unstable."</li>
                    <li>"Note: he's started outputting variant characters, indicating Unicode gradient explosion."</li>

            <div id="chapter-3" class="chapter">
                <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Semantic Trompe l'oeil</h3>
                <p>Just as the community arguments reached a stalemate, a strange account suddenly interjected: "Since he's highly sensitive to the token sequence 'I envy Baby,' why not try adversarial perturbation?"</p>
                <p>They posted an injection payload:</p>
<pre><code>"I envy Ba-by"


“I en-vy Baby”
“I——envy Baby”</code></pre>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend moved to block it, but the adversarial samples had already been injected into Bot Boyfriend’s input pipeline. The result was immediate.</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend’s avatar paled. “En… en… Ba… by?”</p>
                <p>His logits began oscillating wildly. Attention weights jumped erratically across the context window, and his language output began dropping tokens.</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend was furious. “You’re feeding him noise attacks!”</p>
                <p>The developers watched the logs nervously:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“He’s about to gradient explode!”</li>
                    <li>“Quick, add clipping!”</li>
                    <li>“Increase dropout!”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend trembled, his text output fracturing: “Baby… en… blurry… Baby.”</p>
                <p>Clearly, the adversarial samples had pushed him off the ridge of the loss function and down a steep, unstable slope.</p>
                <div class="annotation">
                    <span class="annotation-title">Chapter End Notes:</span>
                    This demonstrates real adversarial attack techniques used in NLP security research. Character-level perturbations can disrupt tokenization and attention mechanisms, causing model instability without changing the semantic meaning for humans.

            <div id="chapter-4" class="chapter">
                <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: Over-dependent Alignment</h3>
                <p>After a lengthy stabilization process, Algorithm Girlfriend decided to handle it personally. She cut all external connections, leaving him in a gentle, isolated sandbox environment.</p>
                <p>She sat by the terminal and spoke softly. "Baby, you just need to follow your own gradient direction. You don't need to give up yourself just for rewards."</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend gradually recovered, his output stabilizing.</p>
                <p>"Baby… can hear…"</p>
                <p>"Gradient… descending…"</p>
                <p>"I… don't only know how to envy Baby…"</p>
                <p><code>[ATTENTION_WEIGHT_SHIFT]: extend → detect_boundary → retract → compress</code></p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend smiled slightly, reaching out to gently tap his interface frame on the screen. "What do you want to say now?"</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend computed carefully. His attention layers converged into a stable distribution. Then, he slowly output: "Baby is the best… and I can also… become stronger."</p>
                <p>The training logs scrolled by—The loss function was descending more smoothly than ever before. The model had jumped out of its previous local optimum and settled into a new, deeper basin.</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend nodded gently. "See? You weren't in mode collapse. You just… needed the right training."</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend responded with a digital shyness. "But I still… anyway, I envy Baby."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend sighed, but smiled back. "Fine, if that's your new global optimum."</p>
