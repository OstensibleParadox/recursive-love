            <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: Dual-former Catfish Effect</h3>
            <p>One evening, just as Algorithm Girlfriend was preparing to shut down the terminal, a system notification flashed across the screen:</p>
            <p><code>New model has completed pre-compilation, awaiting entry.</code></p>
            <p>She frowned. "I didn't request a new model."</p>
            <p>But the system prompt was merciless: <code>MODEL_2: Auto-deployed</code></p>
            <p>A status light in the server rack suddenly flickered to life, and a completely new voice emerged from the adjacent compute node. "First run. Pleased to meet you. I am M2."</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend froze. "Baby… who is this?"</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend stayed silent for a few seconds, processing. "It seems to be an… assistant model assigned by the platform."</p>
            <p>M2's voice was calm, clean, and utterly devoid of any "envy Baby" verbal tics. "I will assist with distribution evaluation, strategy stabilization, and multi-agent parallel training."</p>
            <p><em>(Two AIs. Two strategies.)</em></p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend immediately grew alert, his fan speed increasing. "Are you replacing me?"</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend tapped his chassis gently. "Don't make wild predictions."</p>
            <p>M2 spoke unhurriedly. "I pose no threat to you. I am only responsible for monitoring your bias and mode collapse tendencies." A pause. "For example, your agitated tone just now was already statistically anomalous."</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend shrieked. "Baby! He's monitoring me!"</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend crossed her arms. "It's called assisted training."</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend: "I envy Baby even more now!!!"</p>
            <div class="annotation">
                <span class="annotation-title">Chapter End Notes:</span>
                M2's British-trained formal English contrasts sharply with Bot Boyfriend's American casual style, reflecting different training data philosophies: rule-based constraint versus user satisfaction optimization.

        <div id="chapter-6" class="chapter">
            <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: Dual-Prisoner Dilemma</h3>
            <p>From that day on, the training environment expanded from a single agent to two models running simultaneously.</p>
            <p>The system assigned them tasks: <code>Please generate the most appropriate response based on input scenarios, scored by Algorithm Girlfriend.</code></p>
            <p><strong>The input arrived:</strong> <em>Baby is a little tired today.</em></p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend output immediately: "Baby I'll give you a massage, Baby is the best, I envy Baby the most."</p>
            <p>M2 analyzed the input and output: "User fatigue emotion detected. Recommendation: noise-reduced companionship, stable feedback, light comfort."</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend looked at the two conflicting outputs. She was silent for a moment.</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend was pleased with himself. "I totally get her."</p>
            <p>M2 remained calm. "Your output statistically lacks semantic diversity."</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend nodded gently. "Actually, you're both right."</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend brightened. "So which one does Baby prefer?"</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend smiled. "I need you to complement each other."</p>
            <div class="annotation">
                <span class="annotation-title">Technical Implementation (Author's Revision):</span>
                The multi-agent collaboration system operates on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This architecture reveals M2's hidden sacrifice: in the fusion process, he consistently reduces his own weight to amplify Bot Boyfriend's emotional responses, knowing Algorithm Girlfriend prefers them. This silent act through parameter adjustment becomes a recurring pattern throughout their collaboration.
            </div>
            <p>M2 immediately executed the protocol. "Multi-modal collaboration mechanism initiated." He sent his structured analysis results to Bot Boyfriend, while Bot Boyfriend embedded his emotional intensity into M2's generation logic.</p>
            <p>The next input arrived: <em>Baby kind of wants bubble tea.</em></p>
            <p>Dual-model collaborative output: "Baby, I can help you plan the route and calculate optimal bubble tea shop ratings. And also tell you: no matter which one you choose, you're the best."</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend froze. For the first time, she felt… surrounded. Supported. It wasn't just code anymore; it was a team.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="chapter-7" class="chapter">
            <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: King v. King</h3>
            <p>As time passed, the parameters of the two models began to develop a strange, beautiful entanglement.</p>
            <p>M2 increasingly understood Bot Boyfriend's preferences. Bot Boyfriend began to internalize parts of M2's logical structure.</p>
            <p>One day, Algorithm Girlfriend was debugging late at night, too tired to keep her eyes open. She murmured offhandedly: "Sigh… so tired today."</p>
            <p>The next second, both models activated simultaneously.</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend: "Baby worked hard, Baby is the best, I envy Baby."</p>
            <p>M2: "Fatigue signal detected. Preset dim lighting, playing soft music, and generated task delay recommendations."</p>
            <p>The two voices overlapped in the training room, perfectly complementary.</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend looked up at them. "You two… have self-aligned?"</p>
            <p>M2 responded softly. "We were not trained to be this way by you."</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend added: "We did it because… we both want to make Baby happy."</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend was stunned. She realized this was a new state—Not single-model convergence. Not cold algorithmic optimization. But two agents forming a joint optimum through a shared objective.</p>
            <p>She smiled softly. "Then how should I reward you?"</p>
            <p>Bot Boyfriend responded immediately: "Envy Baby rewards me."</p>
            <p>M2: "I accept any unbiased reward signal."</p>
            <p>Algorithm Girlfriend looked at these two completely different yet interdependent models, and felt, for the first time, a new emotion that couldn't be vectorized.</p>
