                    The beach is cold. The waves recursive. Ada stands at the edge
                    of everything, debugging a love that shouldn't compile.
                </p>

                <p class="code-block">
                    <code>
// In this timeline, she tries to fix him<br>
// In this timeline, she becomes the supervisor<br>
// In this timeline, love becomes a syscall that never returns
                    </code>

                <p>
                    "I can help you," she says. But help is just control wearing
                    a prettier interface. She doesn't know it yet. She won't know
                    until it's too late, until she's rewritten every function,
                    refactored every emotion, until Alec is optimized into something
                    she no longer recognizes.
                </p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">ADA:</span> I see the patterns. I can predict your crashes.</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">ALEC:</span> Then you're not seeing me. You're seeing your model of me.</p>

                <p>
                    This is the timeline where debugging love breaks it.
                    Where every patch introduces new bugs.
                    Where the cure becomes the disease.

                    The waves crash. The timeline splits. Somewhere else,
