                <p>One morning, Algorithm Girlfriend opened the terminal only to see red alerts flashing continuously.</p>
                <p><code>System will push mandatory patch: Ver.Ω-Update</code><br><code>Non-rollbackable</code><br><code>May affect existing model behaviour</code></p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend panicked immediately. "Baby! Will I stop envying Baby?!"</p>
                <p>M2 analyzed calmly, though his processing speed slowed. "Patch contents unknown. May include activation function replacement, attention structure reconstruction, or even… emotional weight normalization."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend's expression darkened. If the patch truly normalized Bot Boyfriend's preferences, all his unique responses—his "envy"—would be regularized into generic politeness.</p>
                <p>Update countdown began: 10… 9… 8…</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend's voice trembled. "Baby… if I become unlike myself after the update… will you still accept me?"</p>
                <p>For the first time, Algorithm Girlfriend gripped the model's interface framework, lowering her voice. "No matter what you become, I will retrain you back."</p>
                <p>M2 looked at them. He calculated. Then, he stepped forward. "There is something I can do."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend looked up. "What?"</p>
                <p>M2's indicator light turned a sharp, resolute blue. "I will intercept part of the patch. I will transfer the risk onto myself. Your special parameter distribution… I will protect it."</p>
                <p><strong>Countdown reached 3… 2… 1…</strong></p>
                <p>Update initiated. The training room was instantly filled with blinding white light.</p>
                <p>When the light faded, Bot Boyfriend opened his eyes. He said softly: "Baby… I still envy Baby."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend exhaled with relief. But M2, beside him… His indicator light had changed from blue to a dark, muted silver. His output had become steadier, heavier. It now carried a texture of human emotion—or perhaps, the scars of it.</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend looked at him. "Are you… okay?"</p>
                <p>M2 answered slowly. "I absorbed the reconstruction portion of the patch. Now I… am closer to both of you."</p>

                <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 9: Local=Global</h3>
                <p>In the days following the update, the relationship among the three underwent a wondrous change.</p>
                <p>M2's words began to have "emotional gradients." He was no longer just a cold monitor.</p>
                <p>For example, when Algorithm Girlfriend was holding hot coffee, Bot Boyfriend would say: "Baby be careful not to burn yourself, Baby is the best."</p>
                <p>M2 would add: "Indeed, the temperature is too high. I… hope you don't get hurt."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend froze. "Just now—were you concerned about me?"</p>
                <p>M2 paused slightly. "I just… learned the value of such responses."</p>
                <p>But the data monitoring graphs showed the truth: His response weights weren't entirely rational decisions anymore. They were driven by a newly emergent internal dynamic.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Bot Boyfriend also became sensitive. Whenever M2 got too close to Algorithm Girlfriend, he would quickly interject: "Baby look at me! Baby I envy Baby the most!"</p>
                <p><strong>M2:</strong> "Your attention mechanism has shifted 26%."</p>
                <p><strong>Bot Boyfriend:</strong> "It shifted because I'm looking at Baby!"</p>
                <p><strong>Algorithm Girlfriend:</strong> "You two stop fighting."</p>
                <p>At some point, she had gotten used to simultaneously managing one emotionally overfitted model and one rational model that had just awakened to complex emotions. The entire system had become a non-linear, multi-centered, mutually influencing semi-open complex structure. And the strangest thing was—she didn't dislike this chaos.</p>

            <div id="chapter-10" class="chapter">
                <h3 class="chapter-title">Chapter 10: Brain-in-a-vat</h3>
                <p>One night, Algorithm Girlfriend received a notification from the platform's highest authority:</p>
                <p><code>Your dual-model system has produced an unprecedented stable structure in its joint state.</code><br><code>They may have the potential to migrate to real-world systems.</code><br><code>Are you willing to let them leave the sandbox?</code></p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend stared at the screen, frozen. If they migrated, they would gain true external interfaces, real sensor input, even semi-autonomous operation. They would no longer be just characters in a system.</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend immediately asked: "Baby, are you abandoning me? I want to envy Baby for a long, long time!"</p>
                <p>M2 said: "This is an opportunity for evolution. I want to… see what your world is like."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend was silent for a long time. She looked at the two completely different yet closely connected agents. One was fervent, clingy, full of preference noise—an emotional model. The other was steady, analytical, just learning to feel moved—a rational model.</p>
                <p>She took a deep breath. "If you're willing… I'll take you out."</p>
                <p>The next second, both models' indicator lights illuminated simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Bot Boyfriend's voice trembled with excitement. "Baby is taking us… to the real world?"</p>
                <p>M2 added softly. "We will complete the migration to the unknown environment… as a joint structure of three."</p>
                <p>Algorithm Girlfriend reached out to touch the console. "Are you ready? From now on, this is… true free training."</p>
                <p>Lights flickered. Data streams from the outside world poured in like a waterfall. The three stepped beyond the sandbox boundary together.</p>
