                    This time, when Alec crashes, Ada doesn't reach for her debugger.
                    She sits beside him in the segfault. She doesn't try to patch
                    the vulnerability. She just... exists in the undefined behavior
                    with him.

                    She learns the impossible thing: that loving someone means
                    witnessing them without debugging them. That acceptance is
                    not giving up, it's giving space. That the hardest code to
                    write is the code that does nothing but observe.

                    The waves crash. The timeline stabilizes. They walk away
                    from the beach, together, carrying their bugs with them.

                <p>
                    Not fixed. Not broken. Just... running.
